_Providing a robots.txt file is not the same as providing robots meta tags for your website._

## Robots? On My Website? 

To be fair, they probably should have named robots [crawlers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Crawler). As in "web crawler". The name _crawler_ refers to what is also called a bot or robot and is a program. Search engines send these robots out to crawl the web and build their search indexes.
